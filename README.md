# Common IT Terms

## History

When first getting into IT I realized that there were a lot of common terms that were used that I did not know the
meaning of. Some of these terms were words that I thought I knew the meaning of because they were found outside of IT
circles, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I decided I should keep a list of the these terms somewhere that other new
to IT people could reference and not feel quite so lost. Enter this Repo.

## Alphabetical listing of terms

### A

### B

- borked:  
When an application is in an equivalent state to FUBAR

### C

- #### c-level: Although it may be obvious to some who this refers, there is a deeper meaning in the IT world. These are the people that will keep your job needed. No matter what discipline of IT you work in. And no, it isn't because they write the checks. You will see it when you deal with them.

### D
- douche waffle: You know that type of person that is just absolutely narcississtic, god's gift to man kind, and for some reason you just want to smack them as soon as they walk through the room? So imagine that persons auora, and put it on anything from humans to computer applications. This is a douche waffle. 

### E

- Error 418: I'm a teapot client error response code indicates that the server refuses to brew coffee because it is, permanently, a teapot. A combined coffee/tea pot that is temporarily out of coffee should instead return 503.

### F

- FUBAR: Acronym for Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition (or Repair). Please see the definition for fucked
- fucked: Depends on usage.
  - If from Consumers, sales people, other non-technical people: This serves as a warning for initiation of the ID10T protocol.
  - If used by hyper-technical people such as sysadmins: This serves as a warning for a resume generating event

### G

### H

- HR: The people that are going to complain about everything you say, do, or think about doing. Also, these are the
  people that want to do things like have group meetings and get to know each other type events. Avoid at all costs. Find
  your company operations team, they will tell you where the HR free zones are located

### I

- ID10T protocol: Pronounced eye dee ten tee. Can also be referred to as the eye dee ten tee RFC, or other technical writing
  standards. If you type this, you can see it is l33t speak for idiot, but it should never be typed to the person
  initiating the protocol (in other words the idiot)

### J

### K

### L

### M

### N

### O

### P

- PEBCAK: See definition for PEBKAC
- PEBKAC: Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Chair. Basically the user has initiated the ID10T protocol. Can also be
  used as PEBCAK

### Q

### R

- Resume Generating Event: Get ready boys and girls, someone fucked some shit and we going to be looking for a new place
  of employment tomorrow
- RFC: Request for Comments. TLDR; A great read for bedtime, if you ever read one you will know why. Exception: Any RFC
  submitted on April 1st of any year. Those are actually pretty funny
- RTFM: Two definitions.
  - Read The Fucking Manual
  - Read The Fucking Monitor.
    Basically, a warning to a technical people they are on the verge of initiating the ID10T protocol themselves because
    the answer to their question is in the documentation, the stack trace on the monitor, or a quick and simple Google/Stack
    Overflow search away. Can also be used when frustrated with non-technical people for their lack of willingness to read
    the documentation about a piece of software they are to use.

### S

### T

- Tango Uniform: HR Safe way to say Tits Up (I must specifically attribute this to G, you know who you are brother)
- TLDR: Too Long, Don't/Didn't Read: Basically, this is your buddy saving you from a long, boring
  (likely written by a c-level/manager/HR type of person) read and giving you an efficient summary of whatever BS the
  document is about
- Tits Up: Dead as fuck. Please also see definition for FUBAR

### U

### V

### W

- wonky: Computing devices are acting like douche waffles

### X

### Y

### Z
